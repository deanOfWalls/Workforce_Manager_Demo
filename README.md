# Workforce Manager Database Demo

Welcome to my SQL demonstration project, the Workforce Manager Database Demo. This repository showcases my expertise in SQL through the design and implementation of a relational database using MariaDB, a community-developed fork of MySQL. Essentially, MariaDB is highly compatible with MySQL, offering similar commands, interfaces, and APIs, but it is often preferred for its open-source nature and enhancements.

## Project Overview

This demo illustrates key database design concepts, including:

- Entity-relationship modeling in a workforce context.
- Implementation of primary and foreign keys for data integrity.
- Data type selection for efficient information storage.
- Optimization techniques through constraints and indexes.

## Features

The schema covers:

- **Employee Management:** Detailed records of employees, including department and role.
- **Department Information:** Organizational departments and their leadership.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Log of employee attendance times.
- **Leave Management:** Tracking of various leave types.
- **Contact Information:** Employee communication details.
- **Address Information:** Employee residence information.

## Getting Started

For a hands-on experience, MariaDB needs to be set up on your system, followed by database creation using the provided SQL scripts. Step-by-step instructions are available in [Documentation.md](./Documentation.md).

### Quick Setup Guide

1. **Install MariaDB:** Follow the provided instructions to install MariaDB.
2. **Secure and Initialize Database:** Secure your installation and prepare your database.
3. **Create Schema:** Use the SQL scripts to create the database schema.
4. **Import Data:** Optionally, use the `workforce_manager.sql` dump file to populate the database with sample data.

For detailed instructions, see [Documentation.md](./Documentation.md).

## Demo Purpose
